Traditionalists will blanche, but after twenty years of lighting a woodburning stove 
at home each day, I have finally perfected the alternative method. Initially like you, I used to 
ball up newspaper and lay kindling on top. This certainly works if you leave the doors slightly
ajar and use enough kindling. But newsprint has evolved to the point where the paper doesn't burn
so well, and most of us have gone over to digital media. The initial tinder supply to hold the match
flame dwindled and I don't use it any more.

Then came a training course on firefighting in 2003. I learnt that the critical trinity for a successful 
fire depends on an adequate supply of fuel, air, and heat: interrupting any one of those elements causes a fire to go out,
and boosting any one of them tends to make the fire burn better.     

I took this knowledge quite literally for several years and used the simple expedient of 
adding a spoonful or two of paraffin to the wood and paper before lighting the stove. The paraffin doesn't vaporise 
if the stove is cold and it burns quite cleanly. Certainly hot enough to act as an accelerant when fire investigators
visit the scene of an arson attack. 

But paraffin isn't the perfect answer, because it sometimes gets spilt between bottle and fireplace, and it doesn't smell
good indoors. Additionaly Janet was concerned whenever she saw me "giving the stove its medicine": she expected a flash-over
and a difficult insurance claim would follow.

The discovery I've made now is a keeper for its cleanliness and simplicity: a butane powered blow-torch costs around a tenner and lasts months for stove lighting. You just need to put in your rounds of timber and a minimal amount of kindling, and then assuming the wood is dry, playing a 1600 degree blowtorch over the wood for ten seconds will reliably light it up. 

Trust me, the only thing you need to remember using this method is not to pick up the blow torch by its brass nozzle after using it.
